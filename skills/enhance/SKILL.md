description: "Run the AIPG enhance workflow, which audits a working system read-only through lenses and returns verified proposals scored by impact for the user to triage. Nothing is applied. Use only when the user explicitly asks for the AIPG enhance workflow."
argument-hint: "[system to audit]"
---

The user wants to run the **enhance-cycle** dynamic workflow on the system below.

First run `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/plugin-access.mjs" check`. The Workflow tool launches only
engines the session can read. On `missing`, unless the working directory is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` or a
folder above it, ask the user once whether to add the printed Read rule to their user settings. On yes,
run the command again with `grant` (settings reload live, no restart). On no, the user can run
`/add-dir ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for this session only.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflows/enhance/CLAUDE.md` and follow it exactly.
Use these paths wherever the guide says "this checkout" or "the tool's own directory":

- Engine `scriptPath`: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflows/enhance/enhance-cycle.mjs`
- `root` arg: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`. Runs land in its `runs/<runId>/`. Never the plugin install dir,
  which is version-swapped on update.
